# ParkEZY - Automated Vehicle Parking System using IoT

## Overview
Due to the **limited number of parking places** and the **increasing number of automobiles**, managing parking in urban areas has become increasingly difficult. To address this issue, **ParkEZY** introduces a **cutting-edge automated vehicle parking system** leveraging **IoT technology** to enhance efficiency and user experience.

## Key Features
- **Automated Entry System**: Uses **ultrasonic and infrared sensors** to detect vehicle arrival and automatically open the entry gate.
- **Real-Time Parking Availability**: Provides users with a **web-based interface** to check parking space availability.
- **Seamless Connectivity**: Utilizes **online connectivity** for real-time data transmission.
- **Arduino Microcontroller Integration**: Ensures smooth hardware operations and efficient sensor-based automation.
- **Traffic Reduction**: Helps reduce congestion at parking entrances by automating vehicle detection and access control.

## How It Works
1. **Vehicle Detection**: Infrared and ultrasonic sensors detect incoming vehicles at the parking entrance.
2. **Automated Gate Control**: The system **automatically opens** the gate upon vehicle detection, ensuring a **hassle-free entry experience**.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: The web interface provides **live information** on available parking slots, reducing time spent searching for parking.
4. **IoT Connectivity**: Sensor data is processed and transmitted via IoT technology for seamless operations.

## Technologies Used
- **IoT (Internet of Things)**
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**
- **Infrared Sensors**
- **Arduino Microcontrollers**
- **Web Interface for Real-Time Monitoring**
